    APPLICATION : MazeRunner Project Overview
========================================================================

Maze Runner - project developed by UFRJ students: Rafael Oliveira, Pedro Cayres, Joao Vitor Duarte.

Maze Runner is a software created using C++. It uses a picture generated by http://www.mazegenerator.net/.
This project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express and Arduino IDE.
Project used OpenCV and .NET Framework.

Requirements:
{OpenCV - related files (change the /includes to your location).

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your SerialCommunication application.

SerialCommunication.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

SerialCommunication.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

SerialCommunication.cpp
    This is the main application source file. This application deals with the Bluetooth communications with the Arduino board.

mazeProcessingClass.cpp
	This file contains the mazeProcessing Class. It contains methods that together solve the maze via image processing checking pixel by pixel and a solution algorithm. 

AssemblyInfo.cpp
	Contains custom attributes for modifying assembly metadata.
